Welcome to the NoteApp repository built using MVVM architecture and Jetpack Compose! 😊

This repository focuses on implementing the Clean Architecture, which emphasizes separation of concerns and maintainability in software development. By following the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architectural pattern, this app aims to provide a robust and organized structure for handling business logic and user interface interactions.

### Features 🚀

- **MVVM Architecture**: Separation of concerns for improved scalability and testability.
- **Jetpack Compose**: Modern UI toolkit for building native Android apps with reactive programming.
- **CRUD Operations**: Full support for creating, reading, updating, and deleting notes.
- **Room Database**: Utilizes Room persistence library for local data storage.
- **Kotlin Coroutines**: Asynchronous programming made easy for handling background tasks.
- **Composable UI**: Declarative UI design for building interactive user interfaces.
- **Easy to Use**: User-friendly interface for managing notes efficiently.

### How to Use 📚

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Build and run the app on an emulator or physical device.
4. Explore the NoteApp functionality within the app.

### Repository Structure 🏗️

- **`app`**: Contains the main source code for the NoteApp.
- **`data`**: Includes data handling, such as repository and data sources.
- **`di`**: Dependency Injection setup using Hilt for managing dependencies.
- **`domain`**: Defines the business logic and use cases for the app.
- **`presentation`**: Manages the UI layer using Jetpack Compose components.
